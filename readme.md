## Don't know if this will work

So you'll need quite a few things to get this working.  I'll try to make this
as 'user friendly' as possible, but I can't make any promises that it will

##### [You'll need pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html)

```sh
cd ~/ # Go to root directory, not overly necessary

```
