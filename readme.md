## Don't know if this will work

So you'll need quite a few things to get this working.  I'll try to make this
as 'user friendly' as possible, but I can't make any promises that it will
be great.  Let me know if anything is confusing.

##### [You'll need pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html)

Everything should be there, but I'll reiterate here.  If you're using a Mac,
open up Terminal.

```sh
cd ~/
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py > get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
```

This *should* install pip properly.  Oh, if you were wondering, pip apparently
stands for ['Pip installs python'](http://esmithy.net/2012/08/25/python-packaging-demystified/).
Clever.
