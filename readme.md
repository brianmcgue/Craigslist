## Don't know if this will work

So you'll need quite a few things to get this working.  I'll try to make this
as 'user friendly' as possible, but I can't make any promises that it will
be great.  Let me know if anything is confusing.

##### You'll need pip

If you're on a Mac, I think the easiest way I know how to do this is with Ruby.
Open Terminal in your Applications.  Enter this:

```sh
cd ~/ # Go to root directory
```
